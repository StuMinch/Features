### A Mobile Automation Practice App

This iOS app is designed to be a vendor-neutral demo for practicing how to write automated tests using frameworks like Appium or native XCUITest. It currently provides functionalities to practice handling:

- Text Input
- iOS System Alerts
- WebViews
- Maps & Location Services
- Generate Network Traffic
- Apple Pay

### Contributing
This project is intended to be a collaborative effort! We welcome contributions that add new functionalities and features for practicing mobile automation.  Here's how you can contribute:

- Fork the repository: Create your own copy of this project on GitHub.
- Add a new feature: Implement your desired functionality for mobile automation practice.
- Submit a pull request: Share your changes with the project maintainers.

### License
This app is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3). Please refer to the LICENSE file for details.

### Getting Started
- Clone this repository.
- Open the project in Xcode.
- Build and run the app on your iOS device or simulator.

### Maps & Location Services
The Map option allows you to dabble with automated tests involving changing locations using Appium or XCUITest.

### Generate Network Traffic
Generate network traffic from the app by triggering 25 GET requests and using any network capture utility to observe the data being transmitted.

### Apple Pay
To make use of the Apple Pay feature, additional steps must be completed using your Apple Developer profile. Please refer to the official Apple Developer documentation for guidance on getting started with Apple Pay.

After completing these steps, ensure that the target is signed with your specific certificates and Merchant ID.

### Future Development
I plan to expand this app's functionalities to cover a wider range of mobile automation scenarios. This includes adding features to practice interacting with:
- Add a UI component to the Map feature so that you can define a desired location directly within the app.
- Different UI elements (buttons, text fields, etc.)
- And more!

Feel free to contribute your ideas and code to help make this a valuable resource for the mobile automation testing community!
